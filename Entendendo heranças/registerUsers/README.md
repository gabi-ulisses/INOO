## Register users

The program allows teachers and students to register. 
The professor has a name, CPF, department and year in which he was hired. The student has a name, CPF,
medical record and course in which you are enrolled. The program must also contain methods for displaying the course in which the student is registered and the year in which the teacher was hired.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
